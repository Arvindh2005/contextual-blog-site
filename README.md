# contextual-blog-site
This project is an AI-powered blogging platform where blogs from a Node.js backend are indexed using FAISS for fast, semantic search. Users can search naturally, and AI features like content moderation ensure safe uploads. The system is modular, allowing easy integration of future AI capabilities like recommendations or summarization.
