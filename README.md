# contextual-blog-site
This project is an AI-powered blogging platform that combines the scalability of Node.js with the intelligence of Python-based AI. Blogs are stored in MongoDB Atlas and served through a Node.js backend, while a Python FastAPI service fetches these blogs and indexes them using FAISS for fast, semantic search. Users can search using natural language queries, and the system retrieves contextually relevant blog posts rather than relying solely on keywords. The platform also includes AI features like content moderation, ensuring safe and appropriate uploads. This modular architecture allows for seamless integration of additional AI capabilities in the future, such as summarization, recommendations, and personalized content delivery, making it both powerful and user-friendly.
